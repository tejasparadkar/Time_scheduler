# Presentation

Auto Shift Planner has an *unique* feature: it can design and automatically make a detailed schedule (roster) while using **heuristic** and **metaheuristic** algorithms. A shift is fine tuned with half hour time units instead as just morning shifts or night shifts. This feature allows the application to manage situations where *traditional planners fail* because it is just impossible to define exactly the desired scenario, for example retail shops with continuous hours with strict staff regulation. Precise **rules** and **preferences** can also be defined as constraints and the application will **automatically generate a schedule** accordingly.

[Tell me why is this important and why should I use this application...](./about.html).

```
The application is not a general purpose factotum planner.
It is a detailed rule based schedule generator.
```

###### Let's see how Auto Shift Planner looks like in action...

# An Example

#### As a manager of a store staff you have to organize shifts for the next week as follows:

*values ​​written in **bold** can be replaced or removed as per needs...*

> The shop opens at **nine AM** and closes at **half past nine PM**. The **supply truck** arrives at **half past eight** on **Monday**, **Wednesday** and **Friday**. **Only** on these days there must be already present staff. There are **seven** employees, **five** of whom work **forty** hours a week and **two** have **twenty-one** hours. **Each** employee has **two** free days per week. An employee asked to have an **extra free** afternoon on Friday. The same employee **must be** in the shop in the morning from **half past nine AM** to **half past ten AM**. No employee can do more than **eight** total hours per day while no one can do less than **three** consecutive hours or more than **six** consecutive hours per day. Each employee may possibly take **only one** break which must however be **one** hour long. In the shop there must always be at least **two** people. Some specific employees must be present during **opening** or **closing** of the shop. All employees are entitled to a night's rest of at least **twelve** hours between one working day and the next. There **must not** be times when there is **too much** staff present or **too little**.

# Roadmap

- Known issues
  - The solving process could be slow in some situations: restarting the solver may help.
  - Enabling "Uniformly distributed employees" (the only soft score constraint) will slow down the solving speed.

- To do 
  - Domain Model could be further improved.
  - A shift is fine tuned with half hour time units: this length should be made configurable in GUI.
  - Implement score calculation using the Drools rule engine.
  - Please contact me if you are in any way interested in this project. Thanks.
